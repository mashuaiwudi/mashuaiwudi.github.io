It was a small step in accounting for one of the most shameful episodes in U.S. history. But it\'s not enough to, as the president did, simply say we won\'t do it again. The larger question is: Why aren\'t the program\'s architects being prosecuted? The methods used, the president said, are "inconsistent with our values as a nation."
