We have uploaded two videos as online appendix materials.

One video is named "Demo of Engagement Cues.mp4" which demonstrates the proposed four kinds of engagement cues for readers to better understand.

The other video is named "UserStudyProcedure.mp4" which illustrates the whole process when users participate in our experiment in the online simulated platform for readers to have a whole picture of our study procedure.
