To help readers better understand our design and the experimental procedure, we have recorded the demonstrations of the four engagement modes we designed at different stages in different skill learning into videos and made an example video to illustrate the entire experimental process.

One video is named "EngagementExpressions.mp4" which demonstrates the proposed four kinds of engagement cues for readers to better understand. The other video is named "UserStudyProcedure.mp4" which illustrates the whole process when users participate in our experiment in the online simulated platform.
