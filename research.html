          <h2>SmartEye: Assisting Instant Photo Taking via Integrating User Preference with Deep View Proposal Network</h2>


          <div class="three_fourth">
            <p>Instant photo taking and sharing has become one of the most popular forms of social networking. However, taking high-quality photos is a difficult task as it requires expertise in composition. In this paper, we present a novel mobile system to help users make good photo compositions in-situ. The back-end of our system is view proposal network (VPN), a deep learning model that processes images and generates composition suggestions in real time. To enable personalization and user adaptation, we extend the model by integrating user preference modeling, which learns to adjust the VPN based on user feedback. We also present novel interfaces to make the system easy to use. User study results show that our proposed model can learn and adapt to users’ preferences, and outperformed pure VPN in suggesting photo compositions.</p>

          <h2>Improving Recognizers’ Performance by Leveraging the Continuity of Gesture Sequence</h2>


          <div class="three_fourth">
            <p>There is an increased opportunity for using gestures made by pens, fingers, arms, or other path-making instruments to implement more intuitive and effective interfaces. However, the range of applying gesture interaction paradigm is limited by its poor recognition performance and high memory burden on users. In this paper, we propose an algorithm framework that using a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) integrated with a partially observable markov decision process (POMDP) to improve the performance of gesture recognition by leveraging the continuity of gesture sequence during the interaction process. In a experiment, we evaluated the improvements brought by our approach for recognizers in a pen-based interface. The results show that the framework enhances the recognition accuracy and reduces memory requirement for users by allowing them to conduct equally complex interactions with a smaller gesture set.</p>

          <h2>Identifying Central Nervous System Disorders from Daily Walking Activities</h2>


          <div class="three_fourth">
            <p>Gait abnormality is a main symptom of central nervous system (CNS) disorders wichi are a group of disorders including cerebrovascular disease (CVD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Huntington's disease (HD). Such CNS disorders are prevalent, devastating but poorly treated especially in the early stage. Daily monitoring and assessment may solve this problem, yet the related technique in this aspect still face big challenges. In this paper, we proposed a novel system for monitoring and assessment symptoms of CNS disorders with daily walking activities in a clinic and a workplace scenarios. We first introduced the method for extracting individual gait from daily walking activities, then we presented how we extracted features reflecting symptoms in CNS Disorder and, finally built a model with these features for identifying CNS disorders. In a study with 49 CNS disorders patients and 46 age-matched healthy people, we found that our approach achieved 83.31% average accuracy using 23-dimension gait features. This result demonstrated the feasibility of identifying CNS disorders via daily walking activities.</p>

          <h2>mirrorU: Scaffolding Emotional Reflection via In-Situ Assessment and Interactive Feedback</h2>


          <div class="three_fourth">
            <p>We present mirrorU, a mobile system that supports users to reflect on and write about their daily emotional experience. While prior work has focused primarily on providing memory triggers or affective cues, mirrorU provides in-situ assessment and interactive feedback to scaffold reflective writing. It automatically and continuously monitors the composition process in three dimensions (i.e., level of detail, overall valence, and cognitive engagement) and provides relevant feedback to support reflection. In a 24-subject pilot deployment, we found that such scaffolding and feedback could help users compose longer reflections with more positive emotion words as well as more insight and causal words. We discuss how the literature on emotional writing informed mirrorU’s design, and highlight the major findings as well as the lessons learned from the pilot study.</p>

          <h2>Implicit Detection of Motor Impairment in Parkinson’s Disease from Everyday Smartphone Interactions</h2>


          <div class="three_fourth">
            <p>In this work, we explored the feasibility and accuracy of detecting motor impairment in Parkinson’s disease (PD) via implicitly sensing and analyzing users’ everyday interactions with their smartphones. Through a 42 subjects study, our approach achieved an overall accuracy of 88.1% (90.0%/86.4% sensitivity/specificity) in discriminating PD subjects from age-matched healthy controls. The performance was comparable to the alternating finger tapping (AFT) test, a well-established PD motor test in clinical settings. We believe that the implicit and transparent nature of our approach can enable and inspire rich design opportunities of ubiquitous, objective, and convenient systems for PD diagnosis as well as post-diagnosis monitoring.</p>
