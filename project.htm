                            In Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), distractions can easily happen to learners, which can be partially alleviated by monitoring the attention level of users and reminding them. However, an engagement prediction algorithm is not always accurate. What influences the performance of the algorithm and how to make it work better? To explore this problem, we first design a prototype, Reminder, which integrates a deep learning model to monitor learners’ engagement and remind them of the distraction. Based on it, we conduct a preliminary user study. Results show that the difference in users’ viewing habits is an important factor leading to the inaccuracy of the algorithm. We then propose RemindMe, a novel user-adaptive tool to personalize the general engagement prediction algorithm implicitly in real-time. User study results show that RemindMe not only provides users a reminder accurately and efficiently but also learns their viewing habits progressively as interacting with them.

                            In MOOC learning, since engagement prediction technologies are not perfect, what impact do inaccurate reminders have on users in both the learning processes and learning outcomes? To explore this problem, we first propose Reminder, a novel tool to monitor users’ attention implicitly in realtime and remind them of disengagement. Then, we purposefully adjust the Recall/Precision of the back-end algorithm to investigate the effect of engagement prediction algorithms with different performances on users’ learning processes and outcomes quantitatively. User study results show that with similar accuracy, a high recall algorithm achieves generally better reminding effects than a high precision one but the latter brings users a more satisfactory experience.

                            Exploring interests and interacting with other viewers based on specific video content are the two most important factors when viewing a video. However, current video sites have not supported viewing suggestion or satisfactory communication opportunities based on video content. In this paper, we first conduct a preliminary survey among 114 participants to investigate the limits in current video watching modes. Then, based on the survey results, we present Co-Lighter, a novel tool for video viewing and comment. Co-Lighter supports viewers to watch videos and share feelings about video content in a collaborative way. Through Co-Lighter, viewers can not only easily know the heat of each clip in a video and get advice from other viewers about which parts of the video are most worth watching, but also dynamically superimposes comments over video content to share feelings with others.

                            Gait abnormality is a main symptom of central nervous system (CNS) disorders which are a group of disorders including cerebrovascular disease (CVD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and Huntington’s disease (HD). Such CNS disorders are prevalent, devastating but poorly treated especially in the early stage. Daily monitoring and assessment may solve this problem, yet the related technique in this aspect still face big challenges. In this paper, we proposed a novel system for monitoring and assessment  symptoms of CNS disorders with daily walking activities in a clinic and a workplace scenarios.

                            Gait abnormality is one of the major symptoms of nervous system diseases such as Parkinson’s disease. In the clinic, assessments tools usually require patients to complete a long and tedious testing process under the supervision of a doctor, which is tremendous pressure for both patients and hospitals. We propose a novel system, which integrates identity recognition algorithm, behavior recognition algorithm, and built-in gait detection model to accelerate the clinical diagnosis process.

                            We present Chronos, an algorithm framework that improves the performance of gesture recognizers by 1) extracting the continuity information from gesture sequences and, 2) enabling designers to optimize the decision-making rewards. The framework is implemented by integrating a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) with a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP).

                            The advancement of AI technologies in recent years is changing the landscape of healthcare systems. In the U.S., AI empowered clinical decision support systems (AI-CDSS) have been proven capable of making diagnosis with scan image data for particular types of cancer. In this paper, we provide an empirical account by studying users’ perception and interaction with a recently deployed AI-CDSS system in rural China.
